### 1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - **Frame Extraction:**
     - Extract frames from boxing match videos at a suitable frame rate (e.g., 30 fps or 60 fps).
     - Label the frames according to the established naming conventions (e.g., `frame_001`, `successfulstraightpunchboxer1`).

   - **Action Annotation:**
     - Manually or semi-automatically annotate frames with the corresponding actions (e.g., punches, knockdowns).
     - Store the labels in a structured format (e.g., XML, JSON) that maps frame numbers to actions.

   - **Data Augmentation:**
     - Perform data augmentation on the frames (e.g., rotations, flips, color adjustments) to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve model robustness.

### 2. **Feature Extraction**
   - **Image Preprocessing:**
     - Convert frames to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels) and normalize pixel values.
     - Optionally, apply filters (e.g., edge detection, blurring) to emphasize relevant features.(not required as of now)

   - **Feature Representation:**
     - Use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) to extract features from the frames.
     - Alternatively, build a custom CNN if you prefer to train from scratch.

### 3. **Model Development**
   - **Action Recognition Model:**
     - **Model Architecture:**
       - Design a CNN or use a pre-trained CNN with additional layers for action classification (e.g., fully connected layers followed by softmax).
     - **Training:**
       - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
       - Train the model on the training set, tuning hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
       - Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

   - **Knockdown Detection Model:**
     - **Model Architecture:**
       - Develop a separate model or an additional output layer in the action recognition model to specifically detect knockdowns.
     - **Training:**
       - Train on annotated knockdown frames, ensuring the model distinguishes between knockdowns and other actions.
      
       - Similar approach for cut detection

### 4. **Model Integration and Fine-Tuning**
   - **Multi-Task Learning (Optional):**
     - Combine the action recognition and knockdown detection into a single multi-task model to optimize training efficiency and prediction consistency.

   - **Post-Processing:**
     - Implement post-processing steps to refine predictions, such as smoothing out predictions across consecutive frames to reduce noise.

   - **Model Fine-Tuning:**
     - Fine-tune the model on a validation set, adjusting hyperparameters, and using techniques like learning rate scheduling or early stopping.

### 5. **Evaluation**
   - **Performance Metrics:**
     - Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
     - Optionally, use video-level metrics to evaluate the overall prediction quality across entire matches.

   - **Explainability (LIME Integration):**
     - Integrate LIME to explain individual predictions, helping users understand why the model made certain decisions.
